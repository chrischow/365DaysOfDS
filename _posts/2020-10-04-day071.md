## Day 2 Lessons
* Liquid (or Jinja) is extremely powerful. Using for loops and filters, I was able to create modals for each digital badge, populating the modal with names from the data file.
* Includes are useful for re-factoring code. I separated the main page sections into separate HTML files for a cleaner `index.html`.
