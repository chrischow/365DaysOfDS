Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

#### Iteration 18
Adjustments:
* Lowered the regularisation parameter to 0.001 (0.1x the default)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 86-87%
* Changing regularisation may not push validation loss any lower - need to test further improvements in architecture

#### Iteration 19
Adjustments:
* Changed regularisation parameter back to default
* Added one additional Conv layer per block with same number of filters

Observations:
* Accuracy: 87-88%
* Good fit: small gap between training and validation loss
* Improvement in top-2 and top-3 accuracy

I'll use this as the final architecture for further testing on other parameters.
