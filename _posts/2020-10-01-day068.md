Today, I resumed work on OKReadyGo. Here's a recap of the wishlist:

1. Progress bars for KRs [COMPLETED]
2. Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads [COMPLETED]
3. Green/yellow/red indicator of progress
4. Progress vs. time charts
    1. For objectives, overall [COMPLETED]
    2. For each objective
    3. For each KR
5. Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress [COMPLETED]
6. Edit button for each KR

## Key Results
Not much progress today. I focused on the design for the detailed OKR display, and converted the default Bootstrap buttons and collapsible cards into panels that are more consistent with the OKReadyGo design. I also re-formatted the Objective tag into some small text at the top left of each box.
