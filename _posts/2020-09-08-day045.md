Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for VGG16.

#### Iteration 9
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 1

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92-93%

This was selected as the final model. Will take a break and go back to optimising Xception tomorrow.
