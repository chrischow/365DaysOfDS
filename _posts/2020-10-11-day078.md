This is a continuation of a project for developing an [event webpage](https://github.com/chrischow/gc50_trial).

Today, I created pivot tables and queries in Google Sheets to automate the computation of stats like the total mileage for different communities and the badges clocked (and when). The latter was particularly challenging, and took some troubleshooting.

## Tasks Completed
* Developed sheets for calculation of raw form data in Google Sheets

## Day 9 Lessons
* Whenever an entry is submitted through Google Forms, Google Sheets creates a new row in the responses sheet, which makes all calculations in adjacent columns in the sheet pointless. This requires a separation of form responses and computations.
* For queries, combine all data first before filtering.
    * In Google Sheets, if a `QUERY` is empty (no rows), an error will be thrown.
    * To overcome this, first use an array `{}` to combine the columns horizontally (using `,` between columns) and vertically (using `;` between tables).
    * Then, use a SQL-like query to select the required columns subject to the required conditions.
