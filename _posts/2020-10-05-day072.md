This is a continuation of a project for developing an [event webpage](https://github.com/chrischow/gc50_trial).

## Tasks Completed
* jQuery carousel and lightbox
* Scrapped the above, and implemented Bootstrap carousel and Lightbox2 lightbox
* Re-organised repository

## Day 3 Lessons
* If a framework has a certain function you're looking for, go for it first. The syntax is familiar, and it's likely to be more efficient than some other inferior plugin.
* Maintain a neat folder structure so you know where to look for and reference files.
