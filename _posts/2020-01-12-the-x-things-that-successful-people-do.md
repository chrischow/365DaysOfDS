Many websites share the *X* things that successful people do at the start of their day, like working out, meditating, or reading. Books like *Tools of Titans* detail these routines as well. When people read these, it is easy to be tricked by the implied logic:

1. Here's what successful people do - it's simple and easy!
2. Therefore, you can be successful too.
3. All you need to do is pay [insert cost of book / website membership here].
  
There could be a fallacy here. It is possible that successful people are able to perform these routines because they have the time and money to do so, not the other way round where the routines make them successful. Even if they did perform these routines for the longest time, we can't correlate routines with success. We ought to look at the huge group of people who perform these routines religiously but are not successful.

Another point here is on oversimplification of complex things. How is it possible that simply performing *X* steps allows us to **master** or **accomplish** things? Is it accurate to say that doing great things can be done in just *X* ways? Today, I put on my skeptic hat when I see articles that tell me how to "get rich" or "master" or "improve" something in just *X* steps.
