Today, I downloaded the full **Multi-Type Aircraft of Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset and started building a CNN with it.

## EDA
After looking through the dataset, I discovered that there were several mislabelled images. There were F-15s labelled as F-16s, and F-4s, F-15s, F-16s, and F-18s labelled as F-22s. I suppose the "F-22" class was supposed to be "Fighter Aircraft". Since there were sufficient images of F-15s, F-16s, F-18s and F-22s, I corrected their labels. I dropped the F-4 images since there weren't enough of them.

In this larger dataset, there were 9,385 images. I split them with a train-test ratio of 75%-25%.

I will use a further split of 75% of the training set for training, and the remaining 25% of the training set for validation. The test set will only be used for final prediction and evaluation.

## Model

### Data Processing
I used the following settings to augment the training/validation and test data:

```py
# Initialise IDGs
train_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=40,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    rescale=1./255,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    vertical_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest',
    validation_split=0.2
)

test_gen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)
```

### Build Model
I used a simple model with 4 convolutional layers:

```py
model = Sequential()

model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), input_shape=(200,200, 3),
                activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))

model.add(Flatten())

model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))

model.add(Dense(22, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
#     optimizer='adam',
    optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0005),
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

I'll be training this model overnight to avoid maxing out my GPU while I do other stuff.
