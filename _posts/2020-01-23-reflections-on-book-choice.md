After reading *The Organised Mind*, I was reminded of the kind of books I like to read. Here are the criteria:

## 1. A New and Interesting Topic
The book must be about a topic that I have not yet read, and one that I'm interested in. Novelty enables speed and sustains interests.

## 2. Concise
The book should be about 180-250 pages long. This forces an author to be concise, and it's not an unreasonable demand. Good authors can communicate their point without blabbering and overloading facts. Of course, if the book is on a topic that I am familiar with, I can artificially shorten the book by glossing over the examples that I already know.

## 3. Stories and Facts
The book should contain a mix of real-life stories and well-structured facts, written in parallel. The facts educate the reader, and the stories assure the reader that what they're learning is verified empirically.

## 4. Pet Peeves
1. I don't appreciate overused dashes and brackets. It's like listening to someone start a sentence, digress to a seemingly related one halfway, then digress to another one halfway again, and so on. It's irritating as hell.
2. I don't like superficial books. Authors of superficial books portray intellect, but the content betrays that image entirely. These are obviously written for profit, not for knowledge sharing. Books on investing by Mary Buffett are a classic example.
3. I don't like books with too many big words. If I have to refer to a dictionary once every few pages to check the meanings of words just to understand the author's arguments, the language is too complex.
