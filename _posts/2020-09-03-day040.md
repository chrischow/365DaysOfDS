Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 7
Although the network has more pooling layers, the image size is twice as big as before. Perhaps choosing an optimal image size can improve performance.

Adjustments:
* Reverted to one FC layer with 512 filters
* Maintained learning rate of 0.00001 (1e-5)
* Image size of 90x90

Observations:
* Accuracy: 68%
* 250 epochs

#### Iteration 8
Lowering the image size resulted in much poorer performance:

* 71x71: 62%
* 90x90: 68%
* 140x140: 78%

Adjustments:
* Image size of 170x170

Observations:
* Accuracy: 79%
* Not much advantage from having a bigger image size
    * 71x71: 62%
    * 90x90: 68%
    * 140x140: 78%
    * 170x170: 80%

## Retraining Layers
At this point, I figured that for the model to improve, I had to retrain some layers in the model. I wrote code to unfreeze the two `SeparableConv` layers in block 14 in the pretrained Xception model. Model is running overnight.
