Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for ResNet50.

#### Iteration 6
Adjustments:
* Unfroze Conv3: 13 Conv layers

Observations:
* Accuracy: 91%

Re-training Conv3 and Conv4 resulted in worse performance. It looks like the optimal model would lie somewhere between only 1 x FC layer and 1 x FC layer + Conv5.
