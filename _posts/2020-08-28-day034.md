Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

#### Iteration 10
Adjustments:
* Reduces FC layers to just one, but doubled the number of filters to 256

Observations:
* Accuracy: 83%

#### Iteration 11
Adjustments:
* Added another FC layer with 256 filters (total 2)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 82%
* Large deviance between training and validation loss - need regularisation

#### Iteration 12
Adjustments:
* Since there's no real benefit, dropped the second FC layer with 256 filters
* Add L2 regularisation for all Conv layers

Observations:
* Very quick convergence
* Accuracy of 86%
* Validation loss was lower than previous iterations
* Much smaller gap between training and validation loss
* Possibly over-regularised?

#### Iteration 13
Adjustments:
* Doubled FC layer to 512 filters

Observations:
* Accuracy: 86-87%

#### Iteration 14
Adjustments:
* Feature-wise centering enabled

Observations:
* Accuracy: 86-87%

#### Iteration 15
Adjustments:
* Increased the regularisation parameter to 0.05 (5x the default)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 84-85%
* Loss wasn't as low as before

#### Iteration 16
Adjustments:
* Increased the regularisation parameter to 0.02 (2x the default)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 85-86%
