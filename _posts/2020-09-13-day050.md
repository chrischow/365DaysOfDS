Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for ResNet50.

#### Iteration 1
Adjustments:
* Image size of 140x140
* 1 x FC layer with 512 nodes
* Learning rate of 0.00001

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90%
* Loss of 0.46

#### Iteration 2
Adjustments:
* Image size of 210x210 to test if a larger image size works better
* Lowered patience to 30 because I'm short of it (lol)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 89%
* Loss of 0.45
