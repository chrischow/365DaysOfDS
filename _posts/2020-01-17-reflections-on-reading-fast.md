Here are the techniques that I've applied to read fast, in order of importance:

## 1. Read on a topic that you're really interested in
When you read on an interesting topic, you are eager to find out more and tend to read faster. On the flipside, reading on an uninteresting topic feels like a drag. You end up dreading the book, and might associate the negative sentiments with reading in general.

## 2. Eye movement
Use proper eye movement to read words in context. See *10 Days to Faster Reading* by Abby Marks-Beale. 

## 3. Creating the right mood
Simple: read when you're in the mood for it. When you're frustrated or when your mind is occupied with something else, recognise that you won't be focused when reading, and don't even start.

## 4. Creating the right environment
Read in a place where you can focus. By that, I mean limited visual and aural distractions, and dimmed light except for your book or e-reader. That puts all the emphasis on the text, and allows you to focus on reading. Personally, I've found reading in a quiet, dark room with a Kindle extremely efficient.
