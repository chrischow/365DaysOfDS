Does this sound familiar: 

*"Honoured to be the keynote speaker for the Facebook Data Science Summit attended by only the top machine learning engineers in the world. My presentation on my paper on GANs received critical acclaim from fellow experts in the field."*

I've seen many posts like these on LinkedIn, and sometimes on Facebook and Instagram. They generally follow the same format:

**[Humble expression e.g. honoured]** to the **[important role or distinguished title]** for the **[important event here]** alongside **[name drop]**, where I **[action here: spoke/discussed/presented something, or received an award]**.

To me, it is perfectly fine to share your achievements, especially if you've done something valuable for your industry or community. The things that don't fit well with selling yourself are *false humility*, and *baseless claims*. 

First, false humility shows when your update is overwhelmingly focused on your achievement, and contains few words or phrases that are usually associated with humility. For example, the sample statement starts with "honoured", and then continues on with not-so-subtle praise for the rest of the statement on the event, the writer's role, his presentation, and himself. Clearly, the writer isn't interested in the honour, but being recognised as a top machine learning engineer.

Second, overselling is obvious when baseless claims are used, whether direct or indirect. In the statement above, the writer hints at the exclusivity of the event by saying it is attended only by "top machine learning engineers", and that he is a "fellow expert". The first point may or may not be true, and requires some verification. Unless the writer is incredibly well-known, this is a baseless claim. Who regards him as an expert, other than himself in this statement? I would think that only the most outstanding individuals in a field would use this phrase to describe others who are not as brilliant but are working hard to get there - a subtle compliment to fellow *professionals*.

That said, there are tasteful ways to sell yourself. Be (1) direct, (2) factual and (3) balanced. 

First, do away with the words of false humility and just share what you did or achieved. Second, don't claim anything that cannot be easily and immediately verified. Third, share how things weren't all smooth and perfect. A version of the above statement amended to my taste would look like this:

*"As the keynote speaker for the Facebook Data Science Summit, I presented my paper on GANs to an audience of 10,000 machine learning engineers. I was slightly nervous having to present to a community of experts, but I enjoyed the experience of sharing my work with like-minded individuals and having meaningful discourse on deep learning and the future of the machine learning profession. I hope to continue contributing ..."*

The key points:
* No superficial humble statement on honour of being a speaker
* No hint at the exclusivity of the event
* Balanced the achievement with the tension of having to present to experts
* Balanced the above point with enjoying the experience
* Focused on the topic: deep learning and the profession
* Closed with a statement of hope

I have come to understand everyone's need to put themselves out there by sharing their achievements. But, there are some ways of ~~humble~~bragging that are more tasteful than others, at least in my opinion.
