Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. After getting the best result thus far using VGG16 by unfreezing **all** layers, I'm revisiting Xception to fine-tune it further using the same approach.

#### Iteration 15
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 8 and 9

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%
* Record Xception loss of 0.5053, but still higher than VGG16's 0.3178

#### Iteration 16
Adjustments:
* Before the number of trainable parameters increases some more, I decided to test the image size one more time: 210x210

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92-93% - not much improvement
