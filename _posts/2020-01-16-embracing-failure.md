Our society is extremely fixated on success. We only put our best feet forward, showing only the successful or impactful projects that we've done. We don't often share how we've failed and what we've learned from our failures. Failures are just as important as successes, because they teach us lessons about how we can improve. We should not be afraid to document and share our failures. We might not be showing others how to successfully do something (and we wouldn't anyway if it is a competitive industry), but at least we're sharing the approaches that won't work. There is value in that too.
