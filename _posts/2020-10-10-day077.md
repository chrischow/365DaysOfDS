This is a continuation of a project for developing an [event webpage](https://github.com/chrischow/gc50_trial).

## Tasks Completed
* Established workflow for pushing code

## Day 8 Lessons
* Merging with GitHub can be done through pull requests: on a repository, choose which repository (and branch) to merge into, and which repository (and branch) to merge from. Then, GitHub will analyse whether the merge can be completed.

I have yet to learn how to resolve conflicts in Git. Also realised that I'm not familiar with the Git CLI, which I should know better. Will investigate this further after the project.
