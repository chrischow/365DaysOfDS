# About PROJECT LOBANG
**PROJECT LOBANG** is about helping people make better decisions.

## Impetus
People make many decisions across different domains and time frames. And it doesn't help that while companies have the legal obligation to make clear the terms and conditions of the sale of goods and services, there is no requirement for them to make *comparisons* of their product with that of their competitors easy for consumers. Consequently, ill-informed con sumers suffer real financial costs, or financial opportunity costs that they may not even know they're paying.

If options were compared on identical criteria, possibly commoditised, and communicated clearly and intuitively, consumers could potentially make better decisions.

## Potential Names
Core values:
* Protection
* Transparency
* Consumers 

# Problem Definition
To deliver the biggest impact possible, PROJECT LOBANG targets the highest-payoff decisions that people make. This will be achieved by (1) setting good defaults, and where it is not clear what good defaults are, (2) facilitate comparison of options on identical criteria. Categorised by time frame, these decisions are:

| Time Frame | Decisions | Nature | Existing Tools |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1-time | Bank account<br>Credit cards | Well-constrained |
| Monthly | Groceries | Highly-varied |
| Annual | Income tax | Well-constrained |
| 1-2 Yrs | Phone / phone plan<br>Utility bills | Well-constrained | None<br>OpenElectricityMarket.sg |
| 5-10 Yrs | Buying a car | Highly-varied | OneShift |
| > 10 Yrs | Buying a house | Highly-varied |
| Varying | Stock investment<br>Property investment | Highly-varied |
