Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 2
Adjustments:
* Lowered learning rate to 0.00001
* Decreased image size to 71x71

Observations:
* Model is underfit, but did not look like it was converging toward the same 80% accuracy as before

#### Iteration 3
Adjustments:
* Maintained learning rate to 0.00001, which was 0.1x that from the first iteration with 140x140 images
* Increased image size back to 140x140

Observations:
* Accuracy: 77% - Model might not be complex enough
* Validation loss is converging at a low level

#### Iteration 4
Adjustments:
* Doubled number of filters in existing FC layer to 512

Observations:
* Accuracy: 77%
* Overfitting: large gap between training and validation loss

#### Iteration 5
Adjustments:
* Lowered learning rate by 10x to 0.000001 (1e-6)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 76%
* 297 epochs
* Looks underfit, but not much prospects for better validation loss / accuracy

#### Iteration 6
Adjustments:
* Added additional FC layer with 512 filters
* Increased learning rate by 10x to 0.00001 (1e-5)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 76%
* 193 epochs
* Looks slightly underfit
