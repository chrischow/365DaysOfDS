Today's work was on OKReadyGo, my app for tracking personal OKRs.

## Front End: KRs
My objective today was to develop [collapsing cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/) to display progress on Key Results (KRs). My process was as such:

1. Read the data from the SQLite database into a pandas dataframe, merging the Objectives and KRs tables.
2. Re-configure the format into a dictionary with Objectives as keys, and a list of KRs as the values.
3. Feed the data into the view.
4. Use a Jinja for loop to iterate through the data:
    1. Objectives are displayed in the button that toggles the collapsible cards.
    2. Each card contains the KR title, due date, and current status.

For now, I've input the current status in words. However, I want to add more features to the cards to display info in a more intuitive manner. Some of the features I liked from other OKR tools:

* Progress bars for KRs
* Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads
* Green/yellow/red indicator of progress

Some other features I thought of:

* Time vs. progress chart
* Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress
