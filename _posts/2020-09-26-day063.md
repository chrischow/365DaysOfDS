Today's work was on OKReadyGo, my app for tracking personal OKRs.

## Front End: KRs
Just to recap, this was the wishlist for features:

1. Progress bars for KRs
2. Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads
3. Green/yellow/red indicator of progress
4. Time vs. progress charts
5. Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress

Today, I implemented S/Ns 1 and 2: progress bars for each KR with a percentage completion on them, and the progress in terms of the actual metric.

To achieve this, I had to re-define the data models. The KR model now looks like this:

* ID
* Key Result (text)
* Start Date
* Deadline
* Metric Name
* Metric Start (value)
* Metric Target (value)
* Objective ID (foreign key)

Then, I added a new model: KR updates. This contained the following fields:

* ID
* KR ID (foreign key)
* Date Update
* Metric Update

Using the metric starting, target, and update values, I was able to compute percentage completion. This was in turn used to create the progress bars. Meanwhile, the metric target/update values were reported in each card. The collapsible cards look like this:

## Forms
After modifying the KR model, I updated the form for adding a new KR as well:

I have yet to create the form for updating KRs. I'll only include this once I create the dashboard for a detailed view of KRs.
