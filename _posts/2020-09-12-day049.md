Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 17
Adjustments:
* Image size reverted to 140x140
* Unfroze blocks 6 and 7

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%

#### Iteration 18
Adjustments:
* Unfroze blocks 4 and 5

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%
* Loss of 0.6595 was higher than having only blocks 8-14 trained

Since accuracy improved only marginally, while loss has decreased, I'm stopping here for Xception. The best model was with blocks 8-14 trained, using images of size 140x140.
