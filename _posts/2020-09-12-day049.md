Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 18
Adjustments:
* Image size reverted to 140x140
* Unfroze blocks 6 and 7

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%

#### Iteration 19
Adjustments:
* Unfroze blocks 4 and 5

Observations:
* Accuracy: *93%*
