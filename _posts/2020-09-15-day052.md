Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for ResNet50.

#### Iteration 4
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 3-6 in Conv4: 9 Conv layers

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92-93%

#### Iteration 5
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 1-2 in Conv4

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92%
