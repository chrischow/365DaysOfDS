Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 9
Adjustments:
* Reverted to 140x140
* Unfroze the two SeparableConv layers in block 14

Observations:
* Accuracy: 81%
* Training fit is better, but the model is not generalising well

#### Iteration 10
Adjustments:
* Unfroze another two SeparableConv layers, this time in block 13
* Lowered learning rate to 0.000005 after observing that training loss was almost zero, but validation loss was stuck
* Added L2 regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 82%
* Model is fitting well

#### Iteration 11
Adjustments:
* Unfroze another three SeparableConv layers, this time in block 12
* Unfroze the Conv layer in block 13
* All with L2 regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 89%
* Model is fitting well

#### Iteration 12
Adjustments:
* Unfroze another three SeparableConv layers, this time in block 11
* All with L2 regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90%
