I'm taking a break from image classification again. I haven't been learning anything new, just repeating the same process of tweaking CNN parameters, interpreting results, and updating the model to improve the model accuracy.

At the same time, I've been reading [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer) by Andy Hunt and David Thomas. It's made my hands itchy - I feel like building something. As such, today's data science work was on developing Flask applications. This was more of web development and not exactly machine learning, but it will come in handy when developing web apps for ML deployment.

## Introducing OKReadyGo
This year, I actually set some private OKRs for personal development, but I failed miserably. I wanted to get more organised, keep current in Flask app development, and add to my portfolio. Hence, I started a new project: **OKReadyGo** for tracking my OKRs.

Today, I created the basic structure for the app, including the `app.py` main file, a Users model for logging in, and a simple WTForm for registration and logging in. I also summarised the rules for writing OKRs from the book, [Measure What Matters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39286958-measure-what-matters). Here are the screenshots:

Will work on the database for OKRs tomorrow.
