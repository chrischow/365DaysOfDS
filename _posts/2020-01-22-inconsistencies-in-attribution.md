In appraising staff, managers are careful not to attribute too many of their staff to a single achievement. This raises questions of who led this? How much work did each of them do? And they are right to do so. Logically, not everyone can have more than an equal contribution to the achievement. Surely, someone can be credited as the main contributor.

## Problem 1: Attributing Achievement to Initiatives/Programmes
But the same managers fail to apply the same logic to arguably more rosy team achievements. They make statements like "the 30% improvement in XX was attributable to our initiatives, A, B, and C", or worse yet, three arbitrary qualities of the team. What happened to attribution? How exactly did A, B, and C contribute, and in what proportion? Were there other factors that could have contributed to the improvement? Without measuring contribution, we can't say which initiatives or qualities were important and therefore which ones to cut. That means that we cannot easily measure how good were the initiatives that managers launched, or the team qualities they developed.

## Problem 2: Multiple Non-Competing Claims
At the same time, managers from *other departments* can lay claim to the same achievements. The "30% improvement in XX was also attributable" to another department's initiatives, D, E, and F. Since departments' progress reports aren't typically laid out side by side, any department claiming credit can get away without being questioned what their contribution was.

## Example
To illustrate this, let's use the example of the [increase in employment rate in Singapore](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/employment-rate-citizens-mom-report-12308910). First, the government cannot quantitatively apportion credit for the increased employment rate to its programmes. Second, in independent sales pitches:

* The Ministry of Manpower can attribute the achievement to improved employment practices because of new policies.
* The Ministry of Trade and Industry can attribute it to their work in expanding Singapore's network of Free Trade Agreements.
* The Ministry of Education can attribute it to their enhanced framework for Higher Education to supply the economy with high quality human capital.
* And so on.
