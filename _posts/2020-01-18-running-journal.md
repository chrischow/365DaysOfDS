Some reflections on running this week:

## 1. Pace yourself
I tend to go too fast at the start of my runs. Controlling my speed at the start helped to prolong the heavy breathing, and gave me more energy at the end of the run for a sprint finish.

## 2. Alternating Training
Today, I was starting to get sick of long runs. I swang in the opposite direction and did intervals instead. Alternating training runs with the exact opposite could help to sustain enthusiasm for running.

## 3. General Feeling
Felt good running the 1.78km route. My fastest timing hasn't improved much, but I felt the runs getting easier. My first interval run was also relatively easy at a 5 min pace. Random idea for progressive training:

1. 100m x 5 reps x 5 sets = 2.5km with 30s on, 15s off (12:00 for 2.4km).
2. 100m x 5 reps x 5 sets = 2.5km with 26s on, 15s off (10:24 for 2.4km).
3. 200m x 5 reps x 3 sets = 3.0km, same work-rest cycle.
4. 200m x 5 reps x 4 sets = 4.0km, same work-rest cycle.
5. 300m x 5 reps x 2 sets = 3.0km, same work-rest cycle.
6. 300m x 5 reps x 3 sets = 4.5km, same work-rest cycle.
7. 400m x 4 reps x 2 sets = 3.2km, same work-rest cycle.
8. 400m x 4 reps x 3 sets = 4.8km, same work-rest cycle.
