Today's work was on OKReadyGo, my app for tracking personal OKRs.

## Databases
I prepared the models for storing Objectives and Key Results. I specified the following fields:

* Objectives:
    * Objective
    * Category e.g. health, fitness
* Key Results:
    * Key Result
    * Start Date
    * Status
    * Objective ID (foreign key)

I tested the linkage by reading the data into the OKR dashboard view and merging them using pandas. It worked! Will focus on developing the dashboard further.
