Continuing the course **SQL & PostgreSQL for Beginners: Become an SQL Expert** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql-for-beginners/), I completed the following sections from the course:

1. Joining Tables
2. Subqueries

### Joining More Than Two Tables
```sql
/*
SELECT t1.Column1, t2.Column1, t3.Column1 FROM Table1 t1
JOIN Table2 t2 ON t1.ColumnK = t2.ColumnK
JOIN Table3 t3 ON t3.ColumnK = t2.ColumnK
*/

SELECT d.first_name, d.last_name, mo.movie_name, mr.international_takings, mr.domestic_takings
FROM directors d
JOIN movies mo ON d.director_id = mo.director_id
JOIN movie_revenues mr ON mr.movie_id = mo.movie_id;

SELECT ac.first_name, ac.last_name, mo.movie_name FROM actors ac
JOIN movies_actors ma ON ac.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movies mo ON ma.movie_id = mo.movie_id;

SELECT
	d.first_name as dir_fname, d.last_name as dir_lname,
	mo.movie_name,
	ac.first_name as act_fname, ac.last_name as act_lname,
	mr.international_takings, mr.domestic_takings
FROM directors d
JOIN movies mo ON mo.director_id = d.director_id
JOIN movies_actors ma ON ma.movie_id = mo.movie_id
JOIN actors ac ON ac.actor_id = ma.actor_id
JOIN movie_revenues mr ON mr.movie_id = mo.movie_id;
```

### Union
Rules:
* Must select the same number of columns from each table
* The corresponding columns from each table must have a compatible data type

Removes duplicated values.

```sql
/*
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table1
UNION
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table2
*/

SELECT first_name, last_name, 'director' as category FROM directors
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'actor' as category FROM actors
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### Union All
The only difference from `UNION` is that this does not remove duplicates.

```sql
/*
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table1
UNION ALL
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table2
*/

SELECT first_name FROM directors
UNION ALL
SELECT first_name FROM actors
ORDER BY first_name;
```

## Subqueries

### Uncorrelated Subqueries
* Inner query can run independently
```sql
/*
SELECT Column1, Column2 FROM Table1
WHERE Column2 > 
    (SELECT AGGFUN(ColumnX) FROM TableX);
*/

-- Use filters containing values from another table without joining them
SELECT movie_name FROM movies
WHERE movie_id IN
(SELECT movie_id FROM movie_revenues
WHERE international_takings > domestic_takings);

SELECT mo.movie_id, mo.movie_name, d.first_name, d.last_name FROM movies mo
JOIN directors d ON d.director_id = mo.director_id
WHERE mo.movie_id IN
(SELECT movie_id FROM movie_revenues
WHERE international_takings > domestic_takings);
```

### Correlated Subqueries
```sql
SELECT mo1.movie_name, mo1.movie_lang, mo1.movie_length FROM movies mo1
WHERE mo1.movie_length = 
(
	SELECT MAX(movie_length) FROM movies mo2
    -- Inner query uses a WHERE clause that links table from inner query to the table in the outer query
	WHERE mo2.movie_lang = mo1.movie_lang
);
```
