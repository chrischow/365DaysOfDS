Today, I resumed work on OKReadyGo. Here's a recap of the wishlist:

1. Progress bars for KRs [COMPLETED]
2. Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads [COMPLETED]
3. Green/yellow/red indicator of progress
4. Progress vs. time charts
    1. For objectives, overall [COMPLETED]
    2. For each objective
    3. For each KR [HALF-COMPLETED]
5. Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress [COMPLETED]
6. Edit button for each KR

## Key Results
I created a new feature where the user can click on the date and a modal will pop up with the activity chart. I haven't completed the activity chart itself, but the modal works!

I improved the design for the Manage page. The Objective cards now turn to a different colour to indicate that the cards have been expanded. I also added a scale transform when hovering over each Objective and KR card.
