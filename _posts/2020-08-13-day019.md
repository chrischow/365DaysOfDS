Today, I started on the **Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/). I covered the sections on:

* Neural Network Basics
* Activation Functions
* Cost Functions
* Regression Models
* Classification Models

The theory was nowhere nearly as good as the **Neural Networks and Deep Learning** course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning) by Andrew Ng. I strongly recommend that instead of the theory module from the first section on neural network basics. I might just re-do that course to refresh myself on the theory.

The code-along was great (as usual, for Udemy). I managed to refresh myself on the Keras workflow. This is captured in the notes below:

## Keras
General workflow:

1. Define
2. Compile
3. Fit
4. Evaluate

### Construction
```py
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define layers
model = Sequential()

model.add(Dense(4, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(4, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(4, activation='relu'))

model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mse'
)

# Fit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=250)

# Plot loss
loss_df = pd.DataFrame(model.history.history)
loss_df.plot(); plt.show()
```

### Evaluation
```py
# Evaluate on test set
model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

# Predictions
pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Save/Load
```py
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Save
model.save('test_model.h5')

# Load
later_model = load_model('test_model.h5')
```

### Early Stopping

```py
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Create object
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1, patience=20)

# Add to fit
model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    epochs=100,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)
```
