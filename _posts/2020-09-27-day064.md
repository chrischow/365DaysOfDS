Today's work was on OKReadyGo, my app for tracking personal OKRs.

## Front End: KRs
Just to recap, this was the wishlist for features:

1. Progress bars for KRs [COMPLETED]
2. Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads [COMPLETED]
3. Green/yellow/red indicator of progress
4. Time vs. progress charts
5. Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress

Today, I implemented S/N 5. It took me a while to find a great-looking and implementable progress ring. I tested out several, but some simply didn't turn out right. I finally settled on a solution that involved CSS and jQuery: the aptly named [`jquery-circle-progress`](https://github.com/kottenator/jquery-circle-progress) plugin.

The progress circle was easy to implement, but the text in the center wasn't. I found [this solution](https://jsbin.com/gabeli/8/edit?html,css,js,output) for centering the text.

## Fake Data
I wrote a simple Python script to add some fake objectives, KRs, and updates on those KRs. This will allow me to input the correct data values to the overall Objective and KR achievement, create the time vs. progress charts and explore other features.
