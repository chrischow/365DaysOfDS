Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

I started work on the blog post for this project. I plan to write a series of posts to detail my work:

1. **Part I: Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch:** To detail part of my modelling process and key learning pointers.
2. **Part II: (Transfer) Learning from the Best:** Start over with pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 as the base and fine-tune them.
3. **Part III: The Verdict:** Summarise the results, make an assessment on whether this technology is useful for operators, and propose some recommendations for the way forward in developing a computer vision capability.

I wrote about maybe 50% of the first post:

* Motivation for the project
* Introduce the series
* Data cleaning
* Business problem and evaluation metrics
* First model description and results

As part of this, I recapped and reflected on my model building process, and re-generated some graphs. I also modified the `cccnn.py` script to load the weights from the latest checkpoint for each model to be used for evaluation.

I still have the following to write for the first post:

* Last model description and results
* Conclusion

I'll focus on this post for the next few days.
