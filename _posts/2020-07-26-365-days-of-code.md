**365 Days of Data Science** is an initiative to iteratively improve in Data Science, one day at at time. Here are the rules:

1. I must create or practice something **every day** for 365 days.
2. This can be done in any context e.g. projects, courses.
3. I must write a post every day to present (a) the topics covered (for courses) or project components completed (for projects), along with evidence of work done.
4. For code:
    1. I can code in any language. Related languages are acceptable as well e.g. Javascript, HTML, CSS for web development
    2. I must produce at least 50 lines of code per day.
5. For other tools:
    1. I can use any Data Science-related tool e.g. Power BI or Tableau for visualisation, Access for database applications.
    2. I must produce something tangible.
