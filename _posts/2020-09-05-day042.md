Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for Xception.

#### Iteration 13
Adjustments:
* Unfroze another three SeparableConv layers, this time in block 10
* All with L2 regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 91%
* Gap between training and validation loss is still big

#### Iteration 14
Adjustments:
* Doubled L2 regularisation to 0.02

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90-91%
* Validation loss is now close to training loss

I think I'll stop here for Xception. It clocked the lowest validation loss I've seen so far (0.60), and the highest accuracy (90-91%). I'll start work on VGG16 tomorrow.
