This is a continuation of a project for developing an [event webpage](https://github.com/chrischow/gc50_trial).

## Tasks Completed
* Added more buttons
* Added images and applied colour filters

## Day 5 Lessons
It's possible to colour images using CSS, but it isn't easy because you need to know what each transformation does (e.g. contrast, sepia, hue rotation). It's easier to just modify the image with a proper editor.
