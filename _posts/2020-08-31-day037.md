Today's work was on my blog post the CNN model on the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

I finished up the sections for the final model and conclusion. I also added some new analysis on the predicted probabilities from the models.

Will continue to fine-tune the post and start on the next post tomorrow.
