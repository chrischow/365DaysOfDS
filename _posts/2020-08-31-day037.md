Today's work was on my blog post the CNN model on the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

I finished up the sections for the final model and conclusion. I also added some new analysis on the predicted probabilities from the models. A draft is available [here](https://chrischow.github.io/dataandstuff/drafts/2020-09-05-deep-learning-for-aircraft-recognition/). To see the images, you'll need to run the following command in the browser console:

```js
document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/\.\.\//g, "\.\.\/\.\.\/")
```

Will continue to fine-tune the post and start on the next post tomorrow.
