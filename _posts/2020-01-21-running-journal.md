I discovered something weird about my breathing. The sustainable breathing pattern for me is 1 breath in over 4 steps, and 2 breaths out over 4 steps. It seems as though I am less efficient at breathing out than I am in breathing in. I clocked one of the faster times and at one of the lowest heartrates for the 1.8K route.
