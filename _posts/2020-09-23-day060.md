I'm officially taking a break from the MTARSI project for a while to feed my urge to develop an app. This means the 2nd post in the series will be delayed for a while, but I'm going to accept that for sustainability sake.

## OKR Dashboard
The first order of business was to create the OKR dashboard. I started out by creating new forms for Objective and Key Results (KRs). My Flask / SQLite was pretty rusty, so it took me a while to troubleshoot some issues resulting from mistakes I didn't realise I made. The two biggest ones:

1. Code for establishing relationships between database tables was incomplete: Forgot to add a `db.relationship()` call in the Objective model.
2. When referencing the Objectives table for a drop-down menu, I accidentally attempted to save an ORM result to the KR table: Fixed it by selecting the appropriate element (`objective`) and saving that instead.

Of course, there were also aesthetic issues I had to deal with, like the placement of alerts, boxes and such. Today's work was a good refresher on HTML and CSS too.

I have yet to conceptualise the dashboard for OKRs. Shall take reference from other well-known solutions.
