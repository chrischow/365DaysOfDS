Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for VGG16.

#### Iteration 5
Adjustments:
* Added regularisation of 0.01 to block 5

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90%
* Loss: 0.54, higher than without regularisation

#### Iteration 6
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 4
* Turned off regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90%
* Loss: new record of 0.4068

#### Iteration 7
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 3

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92%
* Loss: new record of 0.3875

#### Iteration 8
Adjustments:
* Unfroze block 2

Observations:
* Accuracy: 92%
* Loss: new record of 0.3295
