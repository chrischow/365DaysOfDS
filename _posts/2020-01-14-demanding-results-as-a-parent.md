In *The Organised Mind*, Levitin wrote about how anyone can edit a Wikipedia page, but not all editors' opinions or edits are valuable. People with certifications generally give more reliable information. This led me to revise my opinion about how our economy is extremely focused on academic qualifications, and how parents demand a lot from their children academically.

My first realisation was that society looks primarily at what qualifications you have, and that is understandable. No business can follow you your entire life to assess how competent you are, or how good a fit you'll be in their company. The best measure we have of competence and character is your academic transcript. We can't blame them for choosing an applicant with straight As over an applicant with straight Bs.

Second, parents probably demand a lot from their children not necessarily because of face or finances, but precisely because academic qualifications are what society cares about. Pushing children to do well academically enables them to be relevant to the economy and be able to make it on their own.

I used to believe that asian parents were too strict. But this realisation has showed me that my perspective was too idealistic - I stand corrected.
