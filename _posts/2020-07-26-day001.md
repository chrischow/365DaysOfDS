My current focus is on **databases**. 
I'm currently taking the course *[SQL & PostgreSQL for Beginners: Become an SQL Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql-for-beginners/)* on Udemy. Today, I completed the sections from the course on the following:

1. Querying Data
2. Aggregating and Grouping Data
3. Database Relationships
4. Joining Tables

Most of the code came from S/Ns 1, 2, and 4.

## Querying Data

### Basic Queries

```sql
-- All columns, all rows
SELECT * from directors;

-- Specific columns, all rows
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM directors;
```

### Queries with Basic Conditions
Logical operators can work with strings as well: based on alphabetic order.

```sql
/*
SELECT [Column Names] FROM [Table Name]
WHERE
    [Column 1] [[= | > | >= | < | <=]] 'value1' [[AND | OR]]
    [Column 2] [[= | > | >= | < | <=]] 'value2';
*/

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE
    age_certificate = '15' AND
    movie_lang = 'Chinese';
```

### Queries with Value Lists
```sql
/* 
SELECT [Column 1], [Column 2] FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Column] [[IN | NOT IN]] ('value1', 'value2');
*/

SELECT * FROM actors
WHERE first_name in ('Bruce', 'John', 'Peter');
```

### Queries on Strings `LIKE` a Pattern
Operators:
* `%`: Any number of characters
* `_`: Exactly one character

```sql
/*
SELECT [Columns] from [Table Name]
WHERE [Column 1] LIKE 'pattern'
*/

SELECT * FROM actors
WHERE first_name LIKE '%rl%';
```

### Queries for `BETWEEN`
This selects records between a range **inclusive of the boundary values**. Works on dates, numerics, and strings. For strings, 'P_' comes after 'P'.

```sql
/*
SELECT [Columns] FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Column 1] BETWEEN value1 AND value2
*/

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE release_date BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1999-07-16';

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE movie_length BETWEEN 90 AND 120;

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE movie_lang BETWEEN 'E' AND 'P';
```

### Ordering Data
```sql
/*
SELECT [Columns] FROM [Table Name]
ORDER BY [Column 1] [[ASC | DESC]]
*/

SELECT * FROM actors
ORDER BY date_of_birth DESC;
```

### Limiting Results
#### Option 1: `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
Offsetting shifts the window for the results down.

```sql
/*
SELECT [Columns] from [Table Name]
LIMIT [N] OFFSET [K]
*/

SELECT * FROM movie_revenues
ORDER BY domestic_takings DESC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;
```

#### Option 2: `OFFSET` and `FETCH`
```sql
/*
SELECT [Columns] from [Table Name]
OFFSET [K]
FETCH FIRST [N] ROW ONLY;
*/

SELECT * FROM movie_revenues
ORDER BY domestic_takings DESC
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH FIRST 10 ROW ONLY;
```

### Distinct Results
```sql
/*
SELECT DISTINCT [Column Names] FROM [Table Name];
*/

SELECT DISTINCT movie_lang, age_certificate FROM movies
ORDER BY movie_lang;
```

### Null Values
```sql
/*
SELECT * FROM [Table Name]
WHERE [Column 1] IS [[NOT]] NULL;
*/

SELECT * FROM actors
WHERE date_of_birth IS NOT NULL;
```

### Setting Column Aliases
Aliases:

* Cannot be used in `WHERE` clauses, because these are run before the aliasing
* Can be used in `ORDER BY` clauses, because these are run after the data is queried and after aliases are applied

```sql
/*
SELECT [Column 1] AS [Column 1 Alias] FROM [Table Name];
*/

SELECT last_name, gender AS sex FROM actors
WHERE gender = 'F'
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### Concatenating Strings
```sql
/*
OPTION 1:
SELECT 'String 1' || 'String 2' AS new_string;

OPTION 2:
SELECT CONCAT([Column 1], [Column 2]) AS [New Column Name] FROM [Table Name];

OPTION 3: Concat with separator
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', [Column 1], [Column 2]) AS [New Column Name] FROM [Table Name];
*/

-- Option 1
SELECT 'Concatted' || 'String' AS new_string;

-- Option 2
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM actors;

-- Option 3
SELECT CONCAT_WS(' ', first_name, last_name) AS full_name FROM actors;
```

## Aggregating and Grouping Data

### Counts
`NULL` entries are not counted.

```sql
/*
SELECT COUNT([Columns]) FROM [Table Name];
*/

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movie_revenues;
SELECT COUNT(international_takings) FROM movie_revenues;
```

### Sum

```sql
SELECT SUM(domestic_takings) FROM movie_revenues;
```

### Max/Min
```sql
SELECT MAX(movie_length) FROM movies;
SELECT MIN(date_of_birth) FROM actors;
```

### Group By
```sql
-- Select 
SELECT COUNT(movie_lang) FROM movies
GROUP BY movie_lang;

-- Cannot combine a column with an aggregate
SELECT movie_lang, AVG(movie_length) FROM movies
GROUP BY movie_lang;

-- Can group by multiple columns
SELECT movie_lang, age_certificate, AVG(movie_length) FROM movies
GROUPBY movie_lang, age_certificate;
```

### `HAVING` Clause
* Filters the aggregate number
* Aggregate functions are not allowed in a `WHERE` clause, hence the need for `HAVING`
* Must be used after the `GROUP BY` clause

```sql
/*
SELECT [Column 1], [Column 2] FROM [Table Name]
GROUP BY [Column 1]
HAVING AGGFUN([Column 3]) = value;
*/

SELECT movie_lang, COUNT(movie_lang) FROM movies
GROUP BY movie_lang
HAVING COUNT(movie_lang) > 1;
```

## Mathematical Operators
* Division: Will return an integer if only using integers
* When performing operations on columns, `NULL` values in any column will result in a math operation returning a `NULL` value for that row

```sql
-- Addition
SELECT 1 + 1 AS addition;

-- Subtraction
SELECT 1 - 1 AS subtraction;

-- Multiplication
SELECT 1 * 2 AS multiplication_int;

-- Division (int) - returns 11
SELECT 35 / 3 AS division_int;

-- Division (float) - returns 11.67
SELECT 35.0 / 3 AS division_float

-- Operation on real columns
SELECT movie_id, (domestic_takings + international_takings) AS total_takings FROM movie_revenues;
```

## Joins

### Inner Joins
```sql
/*
SELECT [Table 1].[Column 1], [Table 1].[Column 2], [Table 2].[Column 1] FROM [Table 1]
INNER JOIN [Table 2] ON [Table 1].[Column X] = [Table 2].[Column Y];
*/

SELECT directors.director_id, directors.first_name, directors.last_name, movies.movie_name FROM directors
INNER JOIN movies ON directors.director_id = movies.director_id;
```

### Inner Joins with Aliases
Add aliases by assigning a name immediately after mentioning Table 1 and Table 2.

```sql
/*
SELECT [Alias 1].[Column 1], [Alias 1].[Column 2], [Alias 2].[Column 1] 
FROM [Table 1] [Alias 1] JOIN [Table 2] [Alias 2] ON [Alias 1].[Column X] = [Alias 2].[Column Y];
*/

SELECT d.director_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, mo.movie_name FROM directors d
JOIN movies mo ON d.director_id = mo.director_id;
```

### Inner Joins with `USING`
* Only applicable if Primary Key in Table 1 has the same name as the Foreign Key in Table 2

```sql
/*
SELECT [Alias 1].[Column 1], [Alias 2].[Column 1] 
FROM [Table 1] [Alias 1] JOIN [Table 2] [Alias 2] USING ([Key Column]);
*/

SELECT mo.movie_name, mr.domestic_takings FROM movies mo
JOIN movie_revenues mr USING (movie_id);
```

### Left Joins

```sql
/*
SELECT [Alias 1].[Column 1], [Alias 2].[Column 1] FROM [Table 1] [Alias 1]
LEFT JOIN [Table 2] [Alias 2] ON [Alias 1].[Column X] = [Alias 2].[Column Y];
*/

SELECT d.director_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, mo.movie_name FROM directors d
LEFT JOIN movies mo ON d.director_id = mo.director_id;
```

### Right Joins
```sql
/*
SELECT [Alias 1].[Column 1], [Alias 2].[Column 1] FROM [Table 1] [Alias 1]
RIGHT JOIN [Table 2] [Alias 2] ON [Alias 1].[Column X] = [Alias 2].[Column Y];
*/

SELECT d.director_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, mo.movie_name FROM directors d
RIGHT JOIN movies mo ON d.director_id = mo.director_id;
```

### Full Joins
```sql
/*
SELECT [Alias 1].[Column 1], [Alias 2].[Column 1] FROM [Table 1] [Alias 1]
FULL JOIN [Table 2] [Alias 2] ON [Alias 1].[Column X] = [Alias 2].[Column Y];
*/

SELECT d.director_id, d.first_name, d.last_name, mo.movie_name FROM directors d
FULL JOIN movies mo ON d.director_id = mo.director_id;
```
