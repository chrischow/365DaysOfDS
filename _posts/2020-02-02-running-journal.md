The breathing pattern of 4-steps-in, 2-steps-out, 2-steps-out has worked really well. It allows me to regulate my HR at the start of the run.

I discovered that my diet is an important part of my run. If I eat too much during the day, or eat unhealthy food, I feel heavy and lethargic. First, too much food equals too much weight. When there hasn't been sufficient time to digest a big meal, I actually feel heavy when I run, especially on the upslope. Second, unhealthy food makes me feel lethargic. Today, I verbalised my lack of motivation before the run. This is not a good practice, even if I am feeling lazy. Hence, I should aim for smaller meals, possibly salads, and eat healthier. If I must eat a big meal, it should be breakfast.
