This is a continuation of a project for developing an [event webpage](https://github.com/chrischow/gc50_trial).

## Tasks Completed
* Developed first draft of sheets in Google Sheets to clean data using pivot tables

## Day 6 Lessons
* Javascript isn't the best tool to process data. It's easier to process it upfront in the database and read it into the webpage.
* This underscores the importance of an **analytical database** to do the heavy duty computations before serving consolidated data to the front end.
* Going one step back, it shows how almost **every application requires ETL** of raw data into something that makes intuitive sense.
