Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

#### Iteration 7
Adjustments:
* Used learning rate of 0.00004

Observations:
* Accuracy of 74%
* Validation loss was slightly more stable

#### Iteration 8
Adjustments:
* Reverted back to iteration 6 (one Conv layer per block), but increased number of filters:
    * Conv blocks: 64/128/256/512
    * Top block: 128-128

Observations:
* Accuracy of 77%

#### Iteration 9
Adjustments:
* Increase complexity: double the number of layers in each Conv block
    * Conv blocks: 64-64/128-128/256-256/512-512
    * Top block: 128-128

Observations:
* Accuracy of 82%
