Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

## Recap of Potential Problems
Yesterday, my model wasn't learning from the data. It was repeatedly predicting only one class for all test samples. From Googling, the potential problems were:

1. Data was not labelled correctly
2. Training data was not randomised
3. Learning rate is too high
4. Activation functions are not linear
5. Model complexity is too low
6. Class imbalance not addressed

After address S/N 6, I experimented with the other problems. I found three issues:

1. The learning rate was too high.
2. The model was underfitted due to the dropout layer in the top block.
3. Model complexity was too low.

I resolved the first two of these three issues by lowering the learning rate to 0.00001 and removing the dropout layer, and ran Model 1 (CCCNN-10 architecture). Accuracy was about 47-50%. I'll increase the model complexity tomorrow.
