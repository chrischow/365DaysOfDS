This is a continuation of **The Complete Python/PostgreSQL Course 2.0** on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-postgresql-database-course/).

Today, I learned the basics of using PostgreSQL in Python:

* Connecting to a database
* Using `.env` variables to mask sensitive information
* Using cursors

As part of the course, I also started building a command line app for creating polls. It allows the user to:

1. Create a new poll, specifying a title and options
2. List open polls
3. Vote on a poll
4. Show poll votes
5. Select a random winner from a poll option

All of the above involves interaction with a local PostgreSQL database. To avoid repetition, I'll share the code after the full app is done.
