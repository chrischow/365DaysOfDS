Having read *Scrum* and *Measure What Matters*, I realised that organisations grow by (1) getting feedback quickly, (2) internalising the feedback, (3) developing improvements for the next iteration, and (4) applying them to operations. In Scrum and OKRs, feedback is extremely fast - one Scrum cycle or weekly check-ins under the OKR system allow an organisation to quickly gather feedback on progress (step 1). That same cycle also enables frontliners and their managers to understand the impediments (step 2) and devise ways to get better in the next cycle (step 3). They immediately apply these in the next cycle (step 4).

It is challenging for the public sector to move in that direction. First, the sheer amount of bureaucracy hampers the expeditious collection of feedback. There must be accountability, which typically results in administratively challenging (or tedious) and lengthy processes. Second, feedback must be approved for some reason. Feedback is gathered by frontliners, who must obtain the stamp of approval that this is what they learned. That process may alter the learning lessons for tactical execution, which is key for improving organisational performance. Third, improvements are slow, because these are essentially new contracts that undergo the same administratively challenging processes. Finally, implementation is slow because of more red tape to ensure accountability in deployment. By the time changes are implemented, the demands have already changed.

The concept of quickly collecting, internalising, and applying feedback was also useful in my fitness training. Every run is an opportunity to gather feedback on the way I run (step 1) and understand why that's a problem or that's good (step 2). In the next runs, I can test an improved technique (step 3), and if that works well, I can incorporate it into my running strategy (step 4).
