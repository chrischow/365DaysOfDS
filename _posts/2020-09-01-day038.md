Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

I've identified four pre-trained models to build upon:

1. Xception
2. VGG16
3. ResNet50
4. InceptionV3

I'll be writing the scripts to train a sequential model on top of these models. If the results are promising, I'll look into other pre-trained models from [this list](https://keras.io/api/applications/).

# Xception
I've started with Xception. I had to figure out how to build the model:

```py
# Load pretrained model and freeze it
base_model = Xception(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(140, 140, 3))
base_model.trainable = False

# Initialise full model
model = Sequential()

# Add base model and flatten
model.add(base_model)
model.add(Flatten())

# Add top layers
model.add(Dense(256, activation='relu',))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(21, activation='softmax'))
```

#### Iteration 1
Adjustments:
* Started with a leraning rate of 0.0001
* Increased image size to 140x140

Observations:
* Accuracy: 77%
* Big gap between training and validation loss
