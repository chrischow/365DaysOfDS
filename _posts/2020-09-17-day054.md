Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for ResNet50.

#### Iteration 7
Adjustments:
* Unfroze only Conv5 blocks 2 and 3 for a total of 6 x Conv layers

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%

#### Iteration 8
Adjustments:
* Unfroze only Conv5 block 3: 3 x Conv layers

Observations:
* Accuracy: 93%

The best ResNet50 model involved training all 3 blocks (10 Conv layers) in Conv5. I will take that as the optimal model and move on to
