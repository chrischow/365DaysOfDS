In *The Organised Mind*, I read about a framework that posits that we think with two "personas": the **Executive** and the **Worker**. The Executive is a planner who sees the big picture, and makes the most logical decisions possible about what is best. He looks at long term goals and ensures that every action is in line with these goals, and that everything is on track. 

The Worker, on the other hand, sees the small picture, focusing on tactical execution. However, there are good Workers and bad Workers. The good Workers drive toward perfection. Their problem is that they get sucked in to perfecting everything that they are unable to keep in mind the purpose of the task assigned to them, let alone the big picture. The bad Workers laze around, and want maximum salary for minimal work.

The Executive and the Worker(s) clash because:

* The Executive cares about the big picture, while the Workers care about the details.
* The Executive cares only about a job well done, while the Workers sometimes care about leisure.
* Only one can prevail at any one time, and there are metabolic costs for switching between the Executive and Worker frames of mind.

The lesson here is that we must proactively switch between the Executive and Worker frames. The Executive sets the broad aim and monitors progress, while the Workers work to perfect details. Tap on the Executive's planning abilities and sense of what is optimal. Tap on the Worker's perfectionism, and don't ignore the negative sentiments that arise from being overworked. Actively seek think through the views of the Executive and Worker e.g. write the perspectives on a single piece of paper. This could help to keep yourself in check.
