Today's work was a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset. The iterations performed were for VGG16.

#### Iteration 1
Parameters:
* 140x140
* 1 x FC layer with 512 filters
* Learning rate of 0.000005

Observations:
* Accuracy: 77%
* Learning rate too low

#### Iteration 2
Adjustments:
* Doubled learning rate to 0.00001
* Increased image size to 210x210

Observations:
* Accuracy: 83%

#### Iteration 3
Adjustments:
* Decreased image size back to 140x140
* Same learning rate (0.00001)

Observations:
* Accuracy: 79%

#### Iteration 4
Adjustments:
* Increased image size back to 210x210
* Unfroze block 5, no regularisation

Observations:
* Accuracy: 90%
* Lowest loss recorded: 0.46
