Today, I resumed work on OKReadyGo. Here's a recap of the wishlist:

1. Progress bars for KRs [COMPLETED]
2. Percentage completion of KR, along with the actual metric of measurement e.g. amount in sales, number of leads [COMPLETED]
3. Green/yellow/red indicator of progress
4. Progress vs. time charts
    1. For objectives, overall [COMPLETED]
    2. For each objective
    3. For each KR
5. Progress ring for overall Objective and KR progress [COMPLETED]

## Progress Rings
On [Day 64](https://chrischow.github.io/365DaysOfDS/2020/09/27/day064.html), I implemented progress rings with static, fake data. Today, my first objective was to write some Python code to process raw OKR/OKR update data into (1) aggregate statistics for the progress rings and (2) a time series for the progress vs. time chart. (1) was used to create the actual progress rings, and (2) was used for the next feature.

## Progress vs. Time Chart for Objectives (Overall)
My second objective today was to implement the time vs. progress chart for the dashboard. I first tested [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), but ran into some issues with data formats and graph formatting. I was slightly discouraged, so I switched over to [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), which I'm more familiar with. Only after implementing a Plotly chart did I realise that it takes much more code to get the chart to automatically resize with its parent div. Hence, I gave Chart.js another go.

This time, I made it work by referencing [this post](https://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/creating-charts-with-chart-js-in-a-flask-application/). The chart looks great and can automatically resize with the panel I put it in.
