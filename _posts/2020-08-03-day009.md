Yesterday, I left off at univariate analysis. Today, I'm implementing some functions for bivariate analysis. I initially thought I could complete the functions for both numeric and categorical data. However, that was rather ambitious. I only managed to complete numeric vs. numeric feature analysis because I'm new to both Streamlit and Plotly.

## Functions for Bivariate Analysis
For bivariate analysis, I once again took reference from [Experimental Design and Analysis](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~hseltman/309/Book/Book.pdf). Here are some screenshots:

### Numeric Features
For pairs of **numeric** features, I computed Pearson and Spearman correlation, created scatterplots with 2D histograms, and automated the estimation of linear regression models.

For pairs of **categorical** features, I computed association scores using Cramer's V, and generated a heatmap and contingency table for the frequency distribution. For **numeric vs. categorical** pairs, I used the Kruskal-Wallis H-test and 1-way ANOVA to measure differences in median/mean across categories.

These functions allow the user to obtain an overview of pairwise relationships, and then drill down to pairs of features to identify non-linear relationships.
