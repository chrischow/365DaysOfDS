Today's work is a continuation of my CNN model for the **Multi-Type Aircraft Remote Sensing Images (MTARSI)** dataset.

## Major Setback
As I started writing a post on the MTARSI dataset, I realised two big mistakes I made.

### Incorrect Labels
As I was collecting sample images to show the 22 classes, I realised that some aircraft were **labelled wrongly**. It was my failure to check the images for this project, because I wrongly assumed that academics who [employed "specialists"]((https://zenodo.org/record/3464319#.X0IjpcgzaUk)) would ensure that the labels were assigned correctly. The fundamental mistakes were as such:

* Mistaking civilian airlines (including the 747) for the C-17, C-5, and KC-10
* Confusing the C-17 and the C-5
* Confusing the C-135 with both the C-17 and C-5
* Classifying all aircraft with tail-mounted engines as the C-21
* Labelled E-2s and E-3s
* Twin-engine propeller aircraft were classified as U-2s
* A-26s were...not A-26s at all
* P-63s were...not P-63s at all

Hence, I did the following:

* Manually re-labelled C-17s, C-5s, KC-10s, and C-135s
* Re-classified C-21s as **Private Jets**
* Re-classified "U-2s" as **Twin Turboprops**
* Combined "A-26s" with "P-63s" in a new category: **Light Aircraft**
* Removed E-2s

### Insufficient Diagnostics
I realised that although I was collecting validation accuracy, I wasn't tracking the categories the model was doing well on, and which categories the model wasn't good at picking out. I should have saved the confusion matrices and accuracy scores *per class*.

## Restarting the Testing
Incorporating the changes above and the things I've learned along the way, I've restarted the project, now with 21 classes:

1. A-10
2. B-1
3. B-2
4. B-29
5. B-52
6. Boeing
7. C-5
8. C-17
9. C-130
10. C-135
11. E-3
12. F-15
13. F-16
14. F-18
15. F-22
16. KC-10
17. Light Aircraft
18. Private Jet
19. T-6
20. T-43
21. Twin Turboprop

Each model will be repeated 10 times with the same train/test split. Confusion matrices and accuracy (by class) will be saved.

The new Model 1 (using the CCCNN-10 architecture) will be running overnight.
