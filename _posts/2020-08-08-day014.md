I completed the **Docker for the Absolute Beginner** course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-docker/). It provided an excellent introduction to Docker, with a good blend of theory, demonstrations, and hands-on labs.

It was my first time learning about containerisation, and I was blown away by the genius of the concept (yea I'm a little behind). I think this is an important technology for making deployable ML applications. Today, although I've taken steps to use version control for all my ML projects, I still have some way to go to writing production-level code. For example, I don't typically use virtual environments, and I don't manage project dependencies.

Containerisation forces you to think through the libraries and dependencies you need to run an application, as well as the other services that you might want to run in parallel. Most importantly, it allows you to share your application with others without software issues.

I hope to hope to explore this further as I learn more about ML deployment.
