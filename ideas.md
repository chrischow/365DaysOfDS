On this page, I list several tools and courses of interest to plan my Data Science journey.

## Tools to Explore
Tools must be (1) open source and (2) commonly-used across tech companies.

## Courses

### Databases
1. **MongoDB - The Complete Developer's Guide 2020 - [Udemy](https://learncsc.udemy.com/course/mongodb-the-complete-developers-guide/):** To develop my skills in working with this popular NoSQL database.
2. **Database Design - [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/database-design):** To improve database fundamentals.

### Computing/Other
1. **PySpark - [DataCamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=spark&tab=courses&facets%5Btechnology%5D%5B%5D=Python):** To pick up skills in distributed data management and machine learning.

## Short Term Development Plan
Given that most competitions on Kaggle are about image classification, raising my Kaggle profile will require me to compete using image processing and deep learning techniques. Therefore, my next roadmap will be:

1. Image Processing
    1. [Biomedical Image Analysis in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python)
2. Deep Learning
    1. [Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-deep-learning-with-keras)
    2. [Advanced Deep Learning with Keras](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-deep-learning-with-keras)
    3. [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://learncsc.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/)

As a challenge, I should aim to incorporate Docker into my workflow for building image classification models.
