Hi, I'm Christian, and I think a lot. 

While many people I know love to travel to faraway places and see things, I'm typically more closed to the world, choosing to stay in to read or code or learn something new. What I realised is that the world in my mind could not be more vibrant. Random thoughts and new ideas constantly flood my mind, and I find *my* world complete without even having to leave my desk chair. 

I prefer to think and journal, and then think some more. But often, my thoughts arrive faster than I can pen them down. I'm left with more questions than answers about the world. Hence, this blog is for me to externalise the questions in my mind, to record my thoughts and provide me with a big picture view of the unknown.
